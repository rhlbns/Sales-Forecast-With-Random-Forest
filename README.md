# Sales-Forecast-With-Random-Forest
On the basis of sales data from 45 different BigMore stores located in different regions, I have predicted the sales for 
each  department in each store.

Repesentative Features of each stores like it's size and type is provided in stores.csv file  

Additioanal features Temperature, Fuel_price, Uneployment etc for each store is provided in features.csv file.

I have used Random forest regressor to train and for modelling. Also I would like to report that Random Forest Regressor
significatly outperforms the SVR both in terms of accuracy as well as trianing time.
