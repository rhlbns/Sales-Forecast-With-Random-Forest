# Sales-Forecast-With-Random-Forest
On the basis of sales data from 45 different BigMore stores located in different regions, I have predicted the sales for 
each  department in each store. Results of the data in test.csv file is written in "results.csv".

Repesentative Features of each stores like it's size and type is provided in stores.csv file  

Additioanal features Temperature, Fuel_price, Uneployment etc for each store is provided in features.csv file.

I have used Random forest regressor to train and for modelling. Also I would like to report that Random Forest Regressor
significatly outperforms the SVR both in terms of accuracy as well as trianing time.
